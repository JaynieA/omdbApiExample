Tau API Example
==============
building off our work with JSON files, objects, and arrays will add an API hit to populate the DOM

Technologies
==============
JavaScript
jQuery (a=Ajax, JSON)
HTML

Objectives
==============
* get user input for search
* assemble search string url
* ajax call to that url
* parse the returned data
* display the data on the DOM

Stretch Goals
==============
[x] alert the user if they left the input empty when trying to search
[x] remove movies from the DOM after a search
[x] instead of replacing the existing search results, append more movies to the DOM on the next search (an array sound handy for this)
[x] JQuery animations for transitions
[x] create functionality to choose and display favorites
[ ] refactor/change delete from favorites so that it deletes from favorites instead of movies array
